# :zap: Approximating Pi

There are a couple different ways of estimating π.Today I will approximate the value of π using the concepts stated below : s 

## :zap: Step 1:
I will draw a circle of radious r and a square of side length 2r as shown below-->
![pic](/circle_square2.png)

## :zap: Step 2:
let the area of circle be A(circ) and that of the square be A(sq). Now,
A(circ)/A(sq)= (πr^2)/(4r^2) = π/4 = ratio(let)
Then,
π = 4*ratio

## :zap: Step 3:
Using Processing we will project Random number of points. It is easy to notice that,
A(circ)/A(sq)=(points in the circle)/(points in the square)

## :zap: Step 4:
According to the source code uploaded We will calculate this ratio.
